In this project, I implemented an interpreter for algebraic notation for recording and describing the moves of hurricane Irma. 
Here I am predicting the wind speed and wind gusts of hurricane Iram as it moves from its starting point to its destination.

I am given the function prototypes in the header file as well as 5 test cases for this project. My C code is to compile and run
perfectly with all test cases using the functions given. I am not to create a main function in my C file.
